    <td>Today we set up the repository for this project and wrote the abstract Celesties class that the Sun, planets, and moons will extend.</td>

    <td>Today, we wrote the Sun class which extends Celesties. The 3D shape of the Sun exists on the screen. We also wrote the outline of the Planet class. </td>

    <td>Today, Tiffany added Planet objects for all of the planets and Pluto. They line up and orbit the Sun, but they leave behind a trail which is something we have to fix. In addition, Sharon started the Moon class for the moons of the planets, on a separate branch. </td>
  </tr>
    <td>5/21/19</td>
    <td>Today we worked on the Moon class and getting the moons to orbit around the planets. We resolved the issue of the trailing planet paths and successfully managed to display the moons. But, we had trouble making the moons orbit correctly. 
  </td>

    <td>5/22/19</td>
    <td>Today we worked on getting the moons to orbit correctly again. We tried using pushMatrix and popMatrix but can't get it to work exactly. We created a branch rotateMoon to experiment with this.
